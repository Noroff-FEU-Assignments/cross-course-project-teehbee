    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">For protection of his or her website, I would first recommend using HTTPS for encryption when transferring data packages. This is especially crucial when it comes to e-commerce sites, where sensitive data in the form of credit card info for example is sent to the web page. Having an SSL certificate is crucial nowadays to make sure that information does not end up in the wrong hands. 
    HTML sanitization is also an important element for web security. This is true both when it comes to client-side and server-side sanitization. Both are needed in order to avoid XSS vulnerabilities (cross-site scripting) 
    Another important step is to make sure the passwords for the site is strong. Having strict requirements for the creation of passwords for your site makes it way more secure.
    Closely related to the previous mention, two factor or other ways of secure authorization and authentication makes the clients web site more secure. Using authentication applications from another hardware, such as a phone for example is a good way of ensuring this. Also, two factor logins with e-mail or SMS codes can be a good option. 
    Especially if the web page is an e-commerce site, automatic timeout is a good practice for web security. E-commerce sites have a lot of sensitive information, especially regarding payments, so the automatic logout helps secure this.
